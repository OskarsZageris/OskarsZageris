Hello there, I'm Oscar ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring software developer, currently developing my PHP skills, but I am always looking forward to expanding my skills. Trying to improve my skills every day.
I like challanging my self to be the best. Programming is a way to never get bored as it combines both - never-ending learning and complex problem-solving.
